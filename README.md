Entropy
Matlab code used to compute ARMA process (with Kalman filter), VAR and C-VAR using maximum entropy density (Master 2 Thesis, cf EntropyTimeSeries.pdf) on daily stock returns of three index (CAC 40, Dax & SP500 for a 30 years period).
NB : VAR and C-VAR codes will be added soon.

Some parts of the code are built from scratch, while other are modified versions of open-source codes.
