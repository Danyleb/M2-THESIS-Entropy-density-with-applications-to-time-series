s# Entropy
Matlab code used to compute ARMA process, VAR and C-VAR using maximum entropy density (Master 2 Thesis) on daily stock returns of three index (CAC 40, Dax & SP500 for a 30 years period).

Some parts of the code are built from scratch, while other are modified versions of open-source codes.
